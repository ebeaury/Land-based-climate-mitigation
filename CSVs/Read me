## map_key_mar2024.csv
# Contains list of strategies, C flux, and area suitable for each
# File is used to call strategies in code

## globalmatrix_mar2024.csv
# Matrix set-up for corrplot (Figure 4B, main text)
# Proportional overlap of focal strategy on area for intersecting strategy
# Negative values = compatible strategies

## summed_freqs_wide_mar2024.csv
# Output dataframe for stacked maps of individual strategies - created by total potential.R, used to create global corrplot
# Notes the area and pixel frequency for each unique combination of strategies
  # Solution = ID associated with each strategy that corresponds to Area (in km) and ObsFreq (number of pixels)
  # Order = Number of strategies that apply
  # Solution_chr = list of abbreviated solutions, corresponds to map_key
  # Remaining columns indicate if each solution/strategy applies (1 = suitable, 0 = unsuitable)
